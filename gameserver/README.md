# factorio-headless

This uses ansible to deploy to a provisioned ubuntu server for hosting.

This assumes:
1. there is a provisioned ansible user
2. you already have valid saves in a folder `/home/factorio/saves`
3. you already have server-settings.json in `/home/factorio/backups/server-settings.json`
